This guide walks you through building a beautiful, efficient terminal setup on macOS—from the terminal app and shell, to prompt, fonts, colors, and plugins.

## Overview and Goals

By the end of this guide, you will have:

- A modern terminal app with tabs, panes, and profiles
- A powerful shell (`zsh`) with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- A stylish prompt with Git info and useful status indicators
- Nerd Font and ligature support for pretty icons and smooth code rendering
- A set of plugins and tools that make daily development more pleasant

You can follow the whole guide or just pick the parts you like.

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- A Mac running macOS 11+ (Big Sur or later is ideal, but most works on Catalina+)
- Homebrew installed, or willingness to install it
- Basic familiarity with the terminal (running commands, editing simple files)

If you don’t have **Homebrew** yet, install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, ensure `brew` works:

```bash
brew --version
```

## Step 1: Choose a Modern Terminal App

The built-in **Terminal.app** is fine, but alternatives look and feel better and have nicer features.

Popular choices:

1. **iTerm2** (classic, very configurable)
2. **Warp** (modern, AI-assisted, batteries-included)
3. **Alacritty** or **WezTerm** (GPU-accelerated, very fast, config-driven)

For this guide, we’ll assume **iTerm2**, because it’s powerful and widely used. You can adapt the color/font parts to other terminals.

### Install iTerm2

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

After install:

- Open **iTerm2** from Applications or Spotlight
- Right-click the Dock icon → **Options → Keep in Dock** if you like

### Basic iTerm2 Settings

Open **iTerm2 → Settings (Preferences)** and tweak:

- **General → Closing**: Check "Confirm closing multiple sessions"
- **Profiles → General**: Set **Working Directory** to "Reuse previous session's directory" if you prefer
- **Profiles → Window**: Adjust transparency or blur if you like a glassy effect
- **Profiles → Keys**: Ensure **Left/Right Option Key** acts as `+Esc` (handy for keybindings in vim/tmux, etc.)

We’ll return here later for fonts and colors.

## Step 2: Use zsh as Your Shell

Modern macOS uses **zsh** as the default shell. Confirm with:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If you see something like `/bin/zsh`, you’re good.

If not, and you’re still on `bash` or something else, list shells:

```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

Then change to zsh:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Log out and log back in (or restart iTerm2) for the change to take effect.

## Step 3: Install a Nerd Font (for Icons and Pretty Glyphs)

Many modern prompts use icons from **Nerd Fonts**. Install one so your prompt and plugins don’t show weird boxes.

A great choice is **MesloLGS Nerd Font** (the one Powerlevel10k recommends) or **FiraCode Nerd Font** (with ligatures).

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
# or
brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

### Set the Font in iTerm2

1. Open **iTerm2 → Settings → Profiles → Text**
2. Under **Font**, click **Change Font**
3. Choose `MesloLGS NF` or `FiraCode Nerd Font`
4. Enable **Use a different font for non-ASCII text** and pick the same font (optional but avoids mismatch)

Now your terminal can display icons and powerline symbols correctly.

## Step 4: Install Oh My Zsh (Zsh Framework)

**Oh My Zsh** is a framework that makes managing your zsh configuration easier, with themes and plugins.

Install Oh My Zsh:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will:

- Back up your old `.zshrc` if you had one
- Create a new `~/.zshrc`
- Switch your shell to use Oh My Zsh

After install, open a new iTerm2 window or run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 5: Install a Beautiful Prompt (Powerlevel10k)

**Powerlevel10k** is a fast, feature-rich theme for zsh with Git info, icons, and more.

### Install Powerlevel10k

```bash
brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
```

Then add it as your theme in `~/.zshrc`.

Open `~/.zshrc` in a text editor (use `nano` if unsure):

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Find the line with `ZSH_THEME=` and change it to:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` in `nano`). Reload the config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Run the Powerlevel10k Configuration Wizard

On first load, Powerlevel10k usually starts an interactive wizard. If it doesn’t, start it manually:

```bash
p10k configure
```

The wizard will:

- Ask if you can see certain symbols (this checks that the Nerd Font works)
- Let you choose prompt style (lean, classic, rainbow, etc.)
- Let you pick which segments to show (time, Git status, exit code, etc.)

Pick whatever looks good to you. You can always rerun `p10k configure` later.

If you ever want to tweak manually, your config lives in `~/.p10k.zsh`.

## Step 6: Add Useful Zsh Plugins

Oh My Zsh supports plugins that add autocompletion, suggestions, and more.

### Recommended Plugins

- `git` – aliases and helpers for Git
- `zsh-autosuggestions` – gray "ghost" suggestions as you type
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting` – colors commands as you type
- `fzf` – fuzzy finder (for history and files)

### Install Plugins

#### 1. zsh-autosuggestions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

#### 2. zsh-syntax-highlighting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### 3. fzf (and keybindings)

```bash
brew install fzf
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

During installation, answer `y` to enabling key bindings and completion if prompted.

### Enable Plugins in `.zshrc`

Open `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Find the line starting with `plugins=` and update it. For example:

```bash
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  fzf
)
```

**Important:** `zsh-syntax-highlighting` must generally be **loaded last**. If you later add more plugins, keep it at the end of the list.

Save the file and reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you should see:

- Light gray suggestions as you type (accept with `Right Arrow` or `End`)
- Colored commands and arguments
- Fuzzy history/file search with `Ctrl+R` (from fzf)

## Step 7: Color Schemes and Transparency

A good color scheme makes your terminal easier to read and more pleasant to look at.

### Import a Color Scheme into iTerm2

You can download popular schemes:

- **Dracula**: <https://github.com/dracula/iterm>
- **One Dark**: search "One Dark iTerm2 color scheme"
- **Solarized Dark**: <https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/>

For Dracula, for example:

1. Download the `.itermcolors` file from the repo
2. In iTerm2, open **Settings → Profiles → Colors**
3. Click **Color Presets… → Import…**
4. Choose the downloaded `.itermcolors` file
5. Select the new preset from the dropdown

### Optional: Adjust Transparency

In **Settings → Profiles → Window**:

- Adjust the **Transparency** slider
- Enable **Blur** to make background text less distracting

Use transparency sparingly; too much makes text hard to read.

## Step 8: Quality-of-Life Aliases and Functions

You can make your terminal more productive with a few handy aliases in `~/.zshrc`.

Open `~/.zshrc` and add something like this near the bottom:

```bash
# Navigation shortcuts
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'

# Listing
alias ll='ls -lah'
alias la='ls -A'

# Git shortcuts
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gp='git push'

# Quick edit and reload of zsh config
alias ez='nano ~/.zshrc'
alias sz='source ~/.zshrc'
```

Save and reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now `ll`, `gs`, etc., will just work.

## Step 9: Optional – Tmux for Tabs and Panes

If you like working with multiple panes and persistent sessions, **tmux** is great.

Install tmux:

```bash
brew install tmux
```

Basic usage:

- Start: `tmux`
- Split window vertically: `Ctrl+B`, then `%`
- Split window horizontally: `Ctrl+B`, then `"`
- Switch panes: `Ctrl+B`, then arrow keys
- Detach session: `Ctrl+B`, then `d`
- List sessions: `tmux ls`
- Attach session: `tmux attach -t <name>`

You can theme tmux to match your colors, but that’s beyond this core guide. Look up popular configs like `gpakosz/.tmux` if you’re curious.

## Step 10: Backup and Sync Your Config

Once you like your setup, keep it safe.

Key files to back up:

- `~/.zshrc`
- `~/.p10k.zsh` (Powerlevel10k config)
- `~/.tmux.conf` (if using tmux)
- Any custom scripts or functions in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`

You can create a simple Git repo to sync config across machines:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles

cp ~/.zshrc .
cp ~/.p10k.zsh . 2>/dev/null || true
cp ~/.tmux.conf . 2>/dev/null || true

git init
git add .
git commit -m "My Mac terminal setup"
```

Push this to a private GitHub repo and pull it on other machines.

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes

### Icons or Symbols Look Broken

- Ensure you selected a **Nerd Font** in iTerm2 (e.g., `MesloLGS NF`)
- In **Profiles → Text**, set both main and non-ASCII fonts to the Nerd Font
- Restart iTerm2 after changing fonts

### Colors Look Weird or Washed Out

- Confirm you applied the color preset in **Profiles → Colors**
- Disable any conflicting themes in your shell that override colors (check `~/.zshrc`)

### zsh-Autosuggestions Not Working

- Make sure the plugin folder exists in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
- Confirm `zsh-autosuggestions` is listed in the `plugins=(...)` line
- Run `source ~/.zshrc`

### zsh-Syntax-Highlighting Not Working

- Ensure `zsh-syntax-highlighting` is the **last** plugin in the list
- Confirm the cloned directory name matches exactly
