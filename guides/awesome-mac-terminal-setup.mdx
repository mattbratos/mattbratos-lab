---


This guide walks you through building a beautiful, efficient terminal setup on macOS—from the terminal app and shell, to prompt, fonts, colors, and plugins.

## Overview and Goals

By the end of this guide, you will have:

- A modern terminal app with tabs, panes, and profiles
- A powerful shell (`zsh`) with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting
- A stylish prompt with Git info and useful status indicators
- Nerd Font and ligature support for pretty icons and smooth code rendering
- A set of plugins and tools that make daily development more pleasant

You can follow the whole guide or just pick the parts you like.

## Prerequisites

You should have:

- A Mac running macOS 11+ (Big Sur or later is ideal, but most works on Catalina+)
- Homebrew installed, or willingness to install it
- Basic familiarity with the terminal (running commands, editing simple files)

If you don’t have **Homebrew** yet, install it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, ensure `brew` works:

```bash
brew --version
```

## Step 1: Choose a Modern Terminal App

The built-in **Terminal.app** is fine, but alternatives look and feel better and have nicer features.

Popular choices:

1. **Ghostty** (modern, GPU-accelerated, fast, config-driven)
2. **iTerm2** (classic, very configurable)
3. **Warp** (modern, AI-assisted, batteries-included)
4. **Alacritty** or **WezTerm** (GPU-accelerated, very fast)

For this guide, we'll use **Ghostty**, a blazingly fast, native macOS terminal app that's GPU-accelerated and highly configurable through a simple config file.

### Install Ghostty

```bash
brew install --cask ghostty
```

After install:

- Open **Ghostty** from Applications or Spotlight
- Right-click the Dock icon → **Options → Keep in Dock** if you like

### Configure Ghostty

Ghostty uses a configuration file instead of GUI settings. Create the config directory and file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty
touch ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

Open the config file in your favorite editor:

```bash
nano ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

Add some basic settings to start:

```bash
# Theme
theme = dark

# Window settings
window-padding-x = 10
window-padding-y = 10

# Transparency (0-100, where 100 is fully opaque)
background-opacity = 0.95

# Cursor
cursor-style = block
cursor-style-blink = true
```

Save the file. Ghostty will automatically reload when you change the config. We'll add font and color settings in the next steps.

## Step 2: Use zsh as Your Shell

Modern macOS uses **zsh** as the default shell. Confirm with:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If you see something like `/bin/zsh`, you’re good.

If not, and you’re still on `bash` or something else, list shells:

```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

Then change to zsh:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Log out and log back in (or restart iTerm2) for the change to take effect.

## Step 3: Install a Nerd Font (for Icons and Pretty Glyphs)

Many modern prompts use icons from **Nerd Fonts**. Install one so your prompt and plugins don’t show weird boxes.

A great choice is **MesloLGS Nerd Font** (the one Powerlevel10k recommends) or **FiraCode Nerd Font** (with ligatures).

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
# or
brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

### Set the Font in Ghostty

Open your Ghostty config file:

```bash
nano ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

Add the font settings:

```bash
# Font configuration
font-family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font"
font-size = 14

# Or if you prefer FiraCode:
# font-family = "FiraCode Nerd Font"
# font-size = 14
```

Save the file. Ghostty will automatically reload and apply the new font.

Now your terminal can display icons and powerline symbols correctly.

## Step 4: Install Oh My Zsh (Zsh Framework)

**Oh My Zsh** is a framework that makes managing your zsh configuration easier, with themes and plugins.

Install Oh My Zsh:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will:

- Back up your old `.zshrc` if you had one
- Create a new `~/.zshrc`
- Switch your shell to use Oh My Zsh

After install, open a new iTerm2 window or run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 5: Install a Beautiful Prompt (Powerlevel10k)

**Powerlevel10k** is a fast, feature-rich theme for zsh with Git info, icons, and more.

### Install Powerlevel10k

```bash
brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
```

Then add it as your theme in `~/.zshrc`.

Open `~/.zshrc` in a text editor (use `nano` if unsure):

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Find the line with `ZSH_THEME=` and change it to:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` in `nano`). Reload the config:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Run the Powerlevel10k Configuration Wizard

On first load, Powerlevel10k usually starts an interactive wizard. If it doesn’t, start it manually:

```bash
p10k configure
```

The wizard will:

- Ask if you can see certain symbols (this checks that the Nerd Font works)
- Let you choose prompt style (lean, classic, rainbow, etc.)
- Let you pick which segments to show (time, Git status, exit code, etc.)

Pick whatever looks good to you. You can always rerun `p10k configure` later.

If you ever want to tweak manually, your config lives in `~/.p10k.zsh`.

## Step 6: Add Useful Zsh Plugins

Oh My Zsh supports plugins that add autocompletion, suggestions, and more.

### Recommended Plugins

- `git` – aliases and helpers for Git
- `zsh-autosuggestions` – gray "ghost" suggestions as you type
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting` – colors commands as you type
- `fzf` – fuzzy finder (for history and files)

### Install Plugins

#### 1. zsh-autosuggestions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

#### 2. zsh-syntax-highlighting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

#### 3. fzf (and keybindings)

```bash
brew install fzf
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

During installation, answer `y` to enabling key bindings and completion if prompted.

### Enable Plugins in `.zshrc`

Open `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Find the line starting with `plugins=` and update it. For example:

```bash
plugins=(
  git
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  fzf
)
```

**Important:** `zsh-syntax-highlighting` must generally be **loaded last**. If you later add more plugins, keep it at the end of the list.

Save the file and reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you should see:

- Light gray suggestions as you type (accept with `Right Arrow` or `End`)
- Colored commands and arguments
- Fuzzy history/file search with `Ctrl+R` (from fzf)

## Step 7: Color Schemes and Transparency

A good color scheme makes your terminal easier to read and more pleasant to look at.

### Configure Colors in Ghostty

Ghostty comes with many built-in themes. You can see available themes by running:

```bash
ghostty +list-themes
```

To use a built-in theme, add this to your `~/.config/ghostty/config`:

```bash
# Popular built-in themes:
theme = "GruvboxDark"
# or
theme = "Dracula"
# or
theme = "OneDark"
# or
theme = "TokyoNight"
```

### Custom Color Schemes

You can also define custom colors in your config file. Here's an example with the popular Catppuccin Mocha theme:

```bash
# Background and foreground
background = 1e1e2e
foreground = cdd6f4

# Cursor
cursor-color = f5e0dc

# Black
palette = 0=45475a
palette = 8=585b70

# Red
palette = 1=f38ba8
palette = 9=f38ba8

# Green
palette = 2=a6e3a1
palette = 10=a6e3a1

# Yellow
palette = 3=f9e2af
palette = 11=f9e2af

# Blue
palette = 4=89b4fa
palette = 12=89b4fa

# Magenta
palette = 5=f5c2e7
palette = 13=f5c2e7

# Cyan
palette = 6=94e2d5
palette = 14=94e2d5

# White
palette = 7=bac2de
palette = 15=a6adc8
```

### Adjust Transparency

We already set transparency earlier, but you can fine-tune it in your config:

```bash
# Background opacity (0.0 - 1.0)
background-opacity = 0.95

# Window blur
background-blur-radius = 20
```

Use transparency sparingly; too much makes text hard to read. A value between 0.90-0.98 usually looks great.

## Step 8: Quality-of-Life Aliases and Functions

You can make your terminal more productive with a few handy aliases in `~/.zshrc`.

Open `~/.zshrc` and add something like this near the bottom:

```bash
# Navigation shortcuts
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'

# Listing
alias ll='ls -lah'
alias la='ls -A'

# Git shortcuts
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gp='git push'

# Quick edit and reload of zsh config
alias ez='nano ~/.zshrc'
alias sz='source ~/.zshrc'
```

Save and reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now `ll`, `gs`, etc., will just work.

## Step 9: Optional – Tmux for Tabs and Panes

If you like working with multiple panes and persistent sessions, **tmux** is great.

Install tmux:

```bash
brew install tmux
```

Basic usage:

- Start: `tmux`
- Split window vertically: `Ctrl+B`, then `%`
- Split window horizontally: `Ctrl+B`, then `"`
- Switch panes: `Ctrl+B`, then arrow keys
- Detach session: `Ctrl+B`, then `d`
- List sessions: `tmux ls`
- Attach session: `tmux attach -t <name>`

You can theme tmux to match your colors, but that’s beyond this core guide. Look up popular configs like `gpakosz/.tmux` if you’re curious.

## Step 10: Backup and Sync Your Config

Once you like your setup, keep it safe.

Key files to back up:

- `~/.config/ghostty/config` (Ghostty configuration)
- `~/.zshrc` (zsh configuration)
- `~/.p10k.zsh` (Powerlevel10k config)
- `~/.tmux.conf` (if using tmux)
- Any custom scripts or functions in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`

You can create a simple Git repo to sync config across machines:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles

cp ~/.config/ghostty/config ghostty-config
cp ~/.zshrc .
cp ~/.p10k.zsh . 2>/dev/null || true
cp ~/.tmux.conf . 2>/dev/null || true

git init
git add .
git commit -m "My Mac terminal setup"
```

Push this to a private GitHub repo and pull it on other machines. When restoring, remember to put the `ghostty-config` file back to `~/.config/ghostty/config`.

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes

### Icons or Symbols Look Broken

- Ensure you set a **Nerd Font** in your Ghostty config (e.g., `font-family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font"`)
- Double-check the exact font name matches what's installed (use `brew list --cask` to verify)
- Restart Ghostty after changing the font in the config

### Colors Look Weird or Washed Out

- Confirm you set a theme in your `~/.config/ghostty/config` file
- Make sure there are no conflicting color settings in your shell config (check `~/.zshrc`)
- Try a different built-in theme using `theme = "ThemeName"`

### zsh-Autosuggestions Not Working

- Make sure the plugin folder exists in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
- Confirm `zsh-autosuggestions` is listed in the `plugins=(...)` line
- Run `source ~/.zshrc`

### zsh-Syntax-Highlighting Not Working

- Ensure `zsh-syntax-highlighting` is the **last** plugin in the list
- Confirm the cloned directory name matches exactly
